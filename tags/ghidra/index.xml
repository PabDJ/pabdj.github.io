When a driver is first loaded, its DriverEntry procedure is called, similar to DLLMain for DLLs.</description></item><item><title>Advanced Dynamic Techniques - OllyDbg</title><link>https://pabdj.github.io/posts/advanceddynamictechniques_ollydbg/advanceddynamictechniques_ollydbg/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Jan 2023 15:20:58 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://pabdj.github.io/posts/advanceddynamictechniques_ollydbg/advanceddynamictechniques_ollydbg/</guid><description>Table of Contents Notes Memory map Breakpoints Loading DLLs Labs Lab 1 Lab 2 Lab 3 Notes Memory map All PE files in Windows have a preferred base address, known as the image base defined in the PE header. The image base isn’t necessarily the address where the malware will be loaded, although it usually is. Most executables are designed to be loaded at 0x00400000, which is just the default address used by many compilers for the Windows platform.</description></item><item><title>Advanced Static Techniques - Analyzing Malicious Windows Programs</title><link>https://pabdj.github.io/posts/advancedstatictechniques_analyzing_malicious_windows_programs/advancedstatictechniques_analyzingmaliciouswindowsprograms/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Dec 2022 14:25:58 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://pabdj.github.io/posts/advancedstatictechniques_analyzing_malicious_windows_programs/advancedstatictechniques_analyzingmaliciouswindowsprograms/</guid><description>Table of Contents Notes Windows API types Windows Registry Registry Root Keys Networking APIs Following running malware Kernel vs. User Mode The Native API Labs Lab 1 Lab 2 Lab 3 Notes DWORD and WORD types represent 32-bit and 16-bit unsigned integers. Windows does not use int, short or unsigned. Windows API types Handles (H). A reference to an object. Long Pointer (LP). A pointer to another type. CreateFile. This function is used to create and open files.</description></item><item><title>Advanced Static Techniques - Recognizing C code constructs in Assembly</title><link>https://pabdj.github.io/posts/advancedstatictechniques_c_code_constructs_in_assembly/advancedstatictechniques_recognizingccodeconstructsinassembly/</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Dec 2022 14:15:58 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://pabdj.github.io/posts/advancedstatictechniques_c_code_constructs_in_assembly/advancedstatictechniques_recognizingccodeconstructsinassembly/</guid><description>Table of Contents Notes Global vs. Local Variables Understanding Function Call Conventions Labs Lab 1 Lab 2 Lab 3 Lab 4 Notes Global vs. Local Variables Global variables are referenced by memory addresses, and the local variables are referenced by the stack addresses. Understanding Function Call Conventions cdecl is one of the most popular conventions. In cdecl, parameters are pushed onto the stack from right to left, the caller cleans up the stack when the function is complete, and the return value is stored in EAX.</description></item><item><title>Advanced Static Techniques - IDA Pro and Ghidra</title><link>https://pabdj.github.io/posts/advancedstatictechniques_idapro/advancedstatictechniques_idapro/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Dec 2022 19:30:58 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://pabdj.github.io/posts/advancedstatictechniques_idapro/advancedstatictechniques_idapro/</guid><description>Table of Contents Notes The IDA Pro Interface Ghidra Modifications References Labs Lab 1 This chapter is about learning the powerful tool called IDA Pro. Unfortunately, this tool requires an expensive license, so I will try to apply all the content from the book into Ghidra.
In My Awesome List there are multiple pointers to interesting tricks and tips to enhance Ghidra. Apart from that, in Create your own malware analysis lab - Upgrading FLARE VM there is a link to several scripts that are thought to provide a similar experience to IDA Pro.</description></item><item><title>Create your own malware analysis lab</title><link>https://pabdj.github.io/posts/create-your-own-malware-analysis-lab/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Dec 2022 12:50:58 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://pabdj.github.io/posts/create-your-own-malware-analysis-lab/</guid><description>Table of Contents Hypervisor Virtual machines Windows XP Windows 7 Upgrading FLARE VM REMnux Environment References The first thing in order to analyse malware is setting up a safe environment with a large set of tools that help you in this task.
As we do not want to infect our host system, we are going to use virtual machines without Internet connection. First of all, we are going to deploy an analysis machine which will have Windows as Operative System and a REMnux machine which will act as a DHCP server.</description></item></channel></rss>
