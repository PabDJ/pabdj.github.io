Apart from that, in Create your own malware analysis lab - Upgrading FLARE VM there is a link to several scripts that are thought to provide a similar experience to IDA Pro.</description></item><item><title>Create your own malware analysis lab</title><link>https://pabdj.github.io/posts/create-your-own-malware-analysis-lab/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Dec 2022 12:50:58 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://pabdj.github.io/posts/create-your-own-malware-analysis-lab/</guid><description>The first thing in order to analyse malware is setting up a safe environment with a large set of tools that help you in this task.
