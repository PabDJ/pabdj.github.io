The image base isn’t necessarily the address where the malware will be loaded, although it usually is. Most executables are designed to be loaded at 0x00400000, which is just the default address used by many compilers for the Windows platform.</description></item><item><title>Advanced Dynamic Techniques - Debugging</title><link>https://pabdj.github.io/posts/advanced-dynamic-techniques_debugging/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Dec 2022 12:25:58 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://pabdj.github.io/posts/advanced-dynamic-techniques_debugging/</guid><description>Notes Kernel vs. User-Mode Debugging It is more challenging to debug kernel-mode code than to debug user-mode code because you usually need two different systems for kernel mode.
Kernel debugging is performed on two systems because there is only one kernel; if the kernel is at a breakpoint, no applications can be running on the system. One system runs the code that is being debugged, and another runs the debugger. Additionally, the OS must be configured to allow for kernel debugging, and you must connect the two machines.</description></item><item><title>Advanced Static Techniques - Analyzing Malicious Windows Programs</title><link>https://pabdj.github.io/posts/advancedstatictechniques_analyzing_malicious_windows_programs/advancedstatictechniques_analyzingmaliciouswindowsprograms/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Dec 2022 14:25:58 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://pabdj.github.io/posts/advancedstatictechniques_analyzing_malicious_windows_programs/advancedstatictechniques_analyzingmaliciouswindowsprograms/</guid><description>Table of Contents Notes Windows API types Windows Registry Registry Root Keys Networking APIs Following running malware Kernel vs. User Mode The Native API Labs Lab 1 Lab 2 Lab 3 Notes DWORD and WORD types represent 32-bit and 16-bit unsigned integers.

Understanding Function Call Conventions cdecl is one of the most popular conventions. In cdecl, parameters are pushed onto the stack from right to left, the caller cleans up the stack when the function is complete, and the return value is stored in EAX.</description></item><item><title>Advanced Static Techniques - IDA Pro and Ghidra</title><link>https://pabdj.github.io/posts/advancedstatictechniques_idapro/advancedstatictechniques_idapro/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Dec 2022 19:30:58 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://pabdj.github.io/posts/advancedstatictechniques_idapro/advancedstatictechniques_idapro/</guid><description>Table of Contents Notes The IDA Pro Interface Ghidra Modifications References Labs Lab 1 This chapter is about learning the powerful tool called IDA Pro. Unfortunately, this tool requires an expensive license, so I will try to apply all the content from the book into Ghidra.
In My Awesome List there are multiple pointers to interesting tricks and tips to enhance Ghidra. Apart from that, in Create your own malware analysis lab - Upgrading FLARE VM there is a link to several scripts that are thought to provide a similar experience to IDA Pro.</description></item><item><title>Advanced Static Techniques - x86 Disassembly</title><link>https://pabdj.github.io/posts/advanced-static-techniques-_-x86-disassembly/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Dec 2022 09:50:58 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://pabdj.github.io/posts/advanced-static-techniques-_-x86-disassembly/</guid><description>Table of Contents Opcodes and Endianness Registers General registers Simple instructions The Stack This blog post collects some notes that I took while reading PMA Chapter 4. As it was not the first time dealing with assembly most of the concepts rang a bell.
Opcodes and Endianness Network data uses big-endian and an x86 program uses little-endian. Therefore, the IP address 127.0.0.1 will be represented as 0x7F000001 in big endian format (over the network) and 0x0100007F in little-endian format (locally in memory)</description></item><item><title>Basic Dynamic Techniques - Notes &amp; Labs</title><link>https://pabdj.github.io/posts/basicdynamictechniques_notesandlabs/basicdynamictechniques_notesandlabs/</link><pubDate>Sat, 17 Dec 2022 12:50:58 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://pabdj.github.io/posts/basicdynamictechniques_notesandlabs/basicdynamictechniques_notesandlabs/</guid><description>Table of Contents Notes Running malware Tools Procmon Process Explorer Regshot ApateDNS InetSim Labs Lab 1 Lab 2 Lab 3 Lab 4 Notes Running malware How to launch DLLs successfully in dynamic analysis: take a look at the Exports with CFF Explorer and afterwards run the following command C:\&amp;gt;rundll32.exe DLLname, Export arguments with one of the Export functions that have appeared in the static analysis.

Packed and Obfuscated Malware Packed and obfuscated code will often include at least the functions LoadLibrary and GetProcAddress, which are used to load and gain access to additional functions.</description></item><item><title>Create your own malware analysis lab</title><link>https://pabdj.github.io/posts/create-your-own-malware-analysis-lab/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Dec 2022 12:50:58 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://pabdj.github.io/posts/create-your-own-malware-analysis-lab/</guid><description>Table of Contents Hypervisor Virtual machines Windows XP Windows 7 Upgrading FLARE VM REMnux Environment References The first thing in order to analyse malware is setting up a safe environment with a large set of tools that help you in this task.
As we do not want to infect our host system, we are going to use virtual machines without Internet connection. First of all, we are going to deploy an analysis machine which will have Windows as Operative System and a REMnux machine which will act as a DHCP server.</description></item><item><title>My Awesome List</title><link>https://pabdj.github.io/posts/my-awesome-list/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Nov 2022 20:50:58 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://pabdj.github.io/posts/my-awesome-list/</guid><description>As a person who is always willing to learn new stuff, one thing that characterizes me is the obsession to save content for the future. The problem of saving content in different social networks is that you end up forgetting about it, and you do not put it in practice. The goal of this post, that will be continuing evolving, is to organise those resources in a useful list.
