What are this malware’s imports and strings?</strong></p><p>The only import that can be observed is ExitProcess from kernel32.dll. This fact already shows suspicious activity but with PEiD we can confirm that the malware sample is packed (PEncrypt 3.1)</p><p>Regarding the strings, they are the following:<figure><img src=../3-1.PNG></figure></p><p><strong>2. What are the malware’s host-based indicators?</strong></p><p>In order to check the manipulations that the malware performs in the victim machine, we run ApateDNS, Procmon, Process Explorer, RegShot and Wireshark . Once all the tools are running, we execute the malware sample with administrator account.
After several tries, it seems that this lab does not work on Windows 7, so we will have to try on Windows XP.</p><p>Results obtained with Regshot:<figure><img src=../3-1-2.PNG></figure></p><p>Wireshark: the data that is sent is not legible and is different between streams.<figure><img src=../3-1-3.PNG></figure></p><p>ApateDNS: the malware tries to connect to the domain www[.]practicalmalwareanalysis[.]com<figure><img src=../3-1-4.PNG></figure></p><p>Procmon: it creates the file <em>vmx32to64.exe</em> and the registry entry &ldquo;<em>HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\VideoDriver</em>&rdquo; apart from several DLL files.<figure><img src=../3-1-5.PNG></figure></p><p><strong>3. Are there any useful network-based signatures for this malware? If so, what are they?</strong>
We observed in the strings the presence of the URL <em>www[.]practicalmalwareanalysis[.]com</em> and in fact the malware tried to connect to that URL.</p><h3 id=lab-2>Lab 2</h3><p><strong>1. How can you get this malware to install itself?</strong></p><p>After checking the exports from the .dll file we know that it has to be installed as a Service.<figure><img src=../3-2.PNG></figure></p><p>We have to run in the console:
<code>C:\>rundll32.exe Lab03-02.dll, installA</code></p><p><strong>2. How would you get this malware to run after installation?</strong></p><p>I tried to run the following command <code>C:\>net start ServiceMain</code> but nothing happened. I had to check the solution because I didn&rsquo;t know which was the name of the service. It is true that one of the strings was <em>IPRIP</em>, but I would have never thought that was the correct name of the service. In fact, I thought it was junk strings.</p><p>Never mind, with <code>C:\>net start IPRIP</code> we can see how the magic goes.</p><p><strong>3. How can you find the process under which this malware is running?</strong></p><p>With the strings examination we observed several references to &ldquo;<em>svchost.exe</em>&rdquo; so we can agree that we should monitor this process.</p><p>After running the sample together with our tools we can confirm that &ldquo;<em>svchost.exe</em>&rdquo; is linked with the malicious DLL. If we use <code>Find ▶ Find Handle or DLL</code> from Procmon we can observe the link.<figure><img src=../3-2-1.PNG></figure></p><p><strong>4. Which filters could you set in order to use procmon to glean information?</strong></p><p>The key filter is the one that allow us to select the events by PID. In our case we retrieved all the information from the process 1084 which is the one linked to &ldquo;<em>svchost.exe</em>&rdquo;.</p><p><strong>5. What are the malware’s host-based indicators?</strong></p><p>The malware created the file &ldquo;<em>net1.exe</em>&rdquo; at &ldquo;<em>C:\Windows\system32</em>&rdquo; and it is playing around with registry entries related to Internet as it can be observed in the following image. The same information was also collected with RegShot.<figure><img src=../3-2-3.PNG></figure></p><p><strong>6. Are there any useful network-based signatures for this malware?</strong>
As we can observe with ApateDNS, the malware tries to connect to &ldquo;www[.]practicalmalwareanalysis[.]com&rdquo;<figure><img src=../3-2-2.PNG></figure></p><h3 id=lab-3>Lab 3</h3><p><strong>1. What do you notice when monitoring this malware with Process Explorer?</strong></p><p>The process ends its execution after a few seconds. Before that, it creates another process &ldquo;<em>svchost.exe</em>&rdquo;.</p><p><strong>2. Can you identify any live memory modifications?</strong></p><p>With Process Explorer we can compare the strings that are loaded in memory and in disk, and we can observe that they are different.</p><table><thead><tr><th style=text-align:center>svchost.exe Image Strings</th><th style=text-align:center>svchost.exe Memory Strings</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><figure><img src=../3-4-1.PNG></figure></td><td style=text-align:center><figure><img src=../3-4-2.PNG></figure></td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>3. What are the malware’s host-based indicators?</strong></p><p>The strings shown by &ldquo;<em>svchost.exe</em>&rdquo; in memory mentioned a file called &ldquo;<em>practicalmalwareanalysis.log</em>&rdquo;.</p><p><strong>4. What is the purpose of this program?</strong></p><p>The strings showed some references to keystrokes such as <em>ENTER</em>, <em>BACKSPACE</em>, etc. After collecting events with Procmon, I restarted the capture, and it was visible that the file take everything that was typed in the notepad to that file.<figure><img src=../3-4-3.PNG></figure></p><figure><img src=../3-4-5.PNG></figure><h3 id=lab-4>Lab 4</h3><p><strong>1. What happens when you run this file?</strong></p><p>It starts a command line process ("<em>cmd.exe</em>") and a few seconds later it ends. Apart from that, when you try to run it again, it deletes itself.</p><p><strong>2. What is causing the roadblock in dynamic analysis?</strong></p><p>After taking a look at the strings, there may be an error during the execution like missing arguments. There are some prints from the code that show that we are covering an unexpected path.<figure><img src=../3-3.PNG></figure></p><p><strong>3. Are there other ways to run this program?</strong></p><p>According to the solution, this question can be answered in future chapters.</p></section><div class=post-tags><nav class="nav tags"><h2 class=title>Tags</h2><ul class=tags><li><a href=/tags/practical-malware-analysis>practical malware analysis</a></li><li><a href=/tags/malware>malware</a></li><li><a href=/tags/reversing>reversing</a></li><li><a href=/tags/basic>basic</a></li><li><a href=/tags/dynamic>dynamic</a></li><li><a href=/tags/analysis>analysis</a></li><li><a href=/tags/registers>registers</a></li></ul></nav></div></article></main><footer><div style=display:flex><a class=soc href=https://github.com/pabdj title=GitHub><i data-feather=github></i></a>
