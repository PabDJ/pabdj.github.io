Although this is true, I also think that most of the people, including me, prefer to keep a <em>low profile</em> and don&rsquo;t expose to the outer side. This is somehow sad because I bet at least <strong>one</strong> people on the entire Earth can find useful the things that someone posts.</p><p>Regarding me, I have read tons of Capture The Flag (CTF) writeups, threat intelligence reports, educational videos, etc. Thanks to the different people that have shared their own perspective about different topics my knowledge has grown so much. I have always had the sense of being in debt with the infosec community and I want to contribute back.
This blog will start with <em>cybersecurity/information security</em> content as a kind of diary but who knows where it ends in the future.</p><p>Apart from that, I agree with Graham Helton&rsquo;s post <a href=https://www.grahamhelton.com/blog/infosecblog1/>Why Should You Start a Security Blog?</a> I think that in order to continue developing my skills, it is better to force myself to show them at public. Writing a malware sample report that will be kept private is not the same as sharing that knowledge that has been acquired to everyone. What&rsquo;s more, the process of communicating technical things in a way that most people can understand them is a great challenge that has to be continuously developed. Thank you to my former Malware Analysis teacher <a href=https://0xjet.github.io/>Juan Tapiador</a> for pushing me to do this.</p><p>The first posts of this blogs will be about <a href=https://www.amazon.es/Practical-Malware-Analysis-Hands-Dissecting/dp/1593272901>Practical Malware Analysis</a> book, which I am going to use in order to learn more about malware and reverse engineering.</p></section><div class=post-tags></div></article></main><footer><div style=display:flex><a class=soc href=https://github.com/pabdj title=GitHub><i data-feather=github></i></a>
