The labs in Practical Malware Analysis (PMA) book are designed to be done with Windows XP but different Reddit users say that most of them can be done in Windows 7.</p><h2 id=hypervisor>Hypervisor</h2><p>There are different platforms that allow us to virtualize machines. For example, PMA Chapter 2 (Malware Analysis in Virtual Machines) suggest to use <a href=https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-player.html>VMWare</a>. It is a good option, nonetheless I will use <a href=https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads>VirtualBox</a> as I am used to using it.
In my case, I have installed VirtualBox 6.1.40 because it is the latest version available.</p><h2 id=virtual-machines>Virtual machines</h2><h3 id=windows-xp>Windows XP</h3><p>If you want a copy, there is a <a href=https://archive.org/details/WinXPProSP3x86>Windows XP Service Pack version (32-bit)</a> available on Archive.org</p><p>With 2 GB of RAM and 20 GB hard drive I think that it is enough.
In this <a href=https://bluesoul.me/practical-malware-analysis-starter-kit/>blog post</a> you can find a list of tools that will be useful for future analysis. At the end of the post you can download them in a ZIP file and install them in your machine.
PMA labs can be downloaded from <a href=https://github.com/mikesiko/PracticalMalwareAnalysis-Labs>here</a></p><h3 id=windows-7>Windows 7</h3><p>First of all, we have to download an ISO file. In <a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/windows7/comments/rm1583/dose_someone_know_how_to_get_a_legitimate_windows/>this subreddit</a> I found an <strong>official</strong> Windows 7 Pro 64-bit disk image. You can download it <a href=https://download.microsoft.com/download/0/6/3/06365375-C346-4D65-87C7-EE41F55F736B/7601.24214.180801-1700.win7sp1_ldr_escrow_CLIENT_PROFESSIONAL_x64FRE_en-us.iso>here</a>.
In order to beat anti-analysis techniques such as anti-virtualization (long story short, malware that detects that it is inside a VM and modifies its behaviour to avoid being analysed) we are going to avoid installing Virtual Box Guest Additions.
Apart from that, we are going to use several tools that try to hide the typical features that malware samples look for to check if they have landed in a virtualized environment.</p><p>Firstly, we are going to test our VM against <a href=https://github.com/a0rtega/pafish>Pafish</a>. This tool performs a collection of checks and will tell us how real our lab is. In my opinion, Pafish is enough but <a href=https://github.com/LordNoteworthy/al-khaser>al-khaser</a> tool seems more complete and updated. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Malware/comments/6fes7n/comment/dj5821a/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3">This Reddit thread</a> also sheds some light over this topic.</p><p>As our lab is going to fail in some tests, I am going to leave some tools in the following list that will allow us to conceal our sandbox.
The first three projects were tested in <a href=https://berhanbingol.medium.com/virtualbox-detection-anti-detection-eng-54a4cde1b509>this blog post</a> but the outcome was not successful. That&rsquo;s why the author implemented his own solution, which is VBoxAntiDetection.
The last project was found in <a href=https://andreafortuna.org/2016/11/07/avoid-malwares-vm-detection-with-antivmdetection/>this blog post</a> and although the post was written in 2016, the tool has been updated in 2021.</p><ul><li><a href=https://github.com/hfiref0x/VBoxHardenedLoader>VirtualBox Hardened Loader</a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/d4rksystem/VBoxCloak>VBoxCloak</a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/JayMontana36/vBoxSysInfoMod>vBoxSysInfoMod</a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/xyafes/VBoxAntiDetection>VBoxAntiDetection</a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/nsmfoo/antivmdetection>Antivmdetection</a></li></ul><p>As we do not want to end up blind, we have to edit some settings to enlarge the VM screen.
After that, we can start configuring our lab environment.</p><p>Hopefully, setting up a malware-analysis lab in Windows 7 is faster thanks to the Flare Team at Mandiant. They have developed <a href=https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/flare-vm-the-windows-malware>Flare VM</a> which is a wonderful tool that automates the creation of fully-working environment with a great set of tools.
The specifications are described in the README repository, but I also attach some videos that show the process of installation.</p><ul><li><a href=https://github.com/mandiant/flare-vm>Flare VM GitHub repository</a></li><li><a href=https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/flare-vm-update>Flare VM installation guide</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1LE56QQ7iA">Malware Analysis Bootcamp - Setting Up Our Environment</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om9lX6QYAvE">How to install FLARE VM</a></li></ul><p>I have configured the VM with a 70 GB hard drive and 5 GB of RAM.</p><div class=callout><div class=callout-inner>‚ö†Ô∏èYou have to update Powershell to Version 3 in order to run FLARE VM installation script.</div></div><h4 id=upgrading-flare-vm>Upgrading FLARE VM</h4><p>Although FLARE VM comes together with a lot of tools, some of them are missing such as Volatility and Ghidra.

Like Kali Linux is thought to be used for pentesting, REMnux contains a lot of useful tools for this task without spending the time installing them. Anyway, you have the option to use other Linux distributions and custom them with the tools that you like. We are going to use REMnux for network forensics.</p><p><a href=https://docs.remnux.org/install-distro/get-virtual-appliance>Download REMnux at the official page</a></p><h3 id=environment>Environment</h3><p>Once we have installed all the tools, do not forget to <strong>set your network adapter to <del>&ldquo;Host-only&rdquo;</del></strong>.</p><p>‚ö†Ô∏èAfter researching more about creating your own malware lab I have read that Host-only network is not a good solution although there are multiple tutorials that suggest this type of network. The best option is to create a subnet in order to avoid possible infections with our host machine.
