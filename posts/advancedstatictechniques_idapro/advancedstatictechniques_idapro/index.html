What is the address of DllMain?</strong></p><p>It was a bit frustrating to see how Ghidra still underperformed IDA even with the free version. IDA perfectly showed the different functions meanwhile Ghidra struggled to name most of them.
Anyway, the address of <em>DllMain</em> is 0x1000D02E.</p><p><strong>2. Use the Imports window to browse to <em>gethostbyname</em>. Where is the import located?</strong></p><p>The import is located at 0x100163CC. Fortunately, we could answer this question easily by filtering the function name in the imports windows.<figure><img src=../5-1.PNG></figure></p><p><strong>3. How many functions call <em>gethostbyname</em>?</strong></p><p>From the picture attached to the previous answer we can observe in green 8 cross-references from other functions, but we have to be careful because it is not counting the declaration of that function. In order to be sure, right click WS2_32.DLL and click References ▶ Show references to <em>gethostbyname</em>.<figure><img src=../5-2-1.png></figure></p><p>After taking into consideration this, we can observe that there are <strong>9</strong> functions that call <em>gethostbyname</em>.<figure><img src=../5-2.PNG></figure></p><p><strong>4. Focusing on the call to gethostbyname located at 0x10001757, can you figure out which DNS request will be made?</strong></p><p>After landing at 0x10001757, we can observe that previously an offset has been moved to <em>eax</em> register. After clicking on it, we are moved to the corresponding string, and we see that the URL is &ldquo;pics[.]practicalmalwareanalysis[.]com&rdquo;<figure><img src=../5-3.PNG></figure><figure><img src=../5-3-1.PNG></figure></p><p><strong>5. How many local variables has IDA Pro recognized for the subroutine at 0x10001656?</strong></p><p>It has recognized 23 local variables<figure><img src=../5-4.PNG></figure></p><p><strong>6. How many parameters has IDA Pro recognized for the subroutine at 0x10001656?</strong></p><p>In the previous image we can observe that <em>lpThreadParameter</em> has been recognized as the parameter of the subroutine.</p><p><strong>7. Use the Strings window to locate the string <em>\cmd.exe /c</em> in the disassembly. Where is it located?</strong></p><p>It is located at 0x10095B34.<figure><img src=../5-5.PNG></figure></p><p><strong>8. What is happening in the area of code that references <em>cmd.exe /c</em>?</strong></p><p>It starts a session with the C2C server.<figure><img src=../5-6.PNG></figure></p><p><strong>9. In the same area, at 0x100101C8, it looks like dword_1008E5C4 is a global variable that helps decide which path to take. How does the malware set dword_1008E5C4? (Hint: Use dword_1008E5C4’s cross-references.)</strong></p><p>First of all, we go to 0x100101C8 address.<figure><img src=../5-7.PNG></figure></p><p>After clicking on dword_1008E5C4, we observe two cross-references to this variable.<figure><img src=../5-7-1.PNG></figure></p><p>The first subroutine, which is the interesting one shows that the value of the variable is set after calling subroutine_10003695. This function retrieves the Windows version so that the malware knows if the target is correct.</p><table><thead><tr><th style=text-align:center>sub_10001656</th><th style=text-align:center>sub_10003695</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><figure><img src=../5-7-2.PNG></figure></td><td style=text-align:center><figure><img src=../5-7-3.PNG></figure></td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>10. A few hundred lines into the subroutine at 0x1000FF58, a series of comparisons use memcmp to compare strings. What happens if the string comparison to <em>robotwork</em> is successful (when <em>memcmp</em> returns 0)?</strong></p><p>It calls subroutine 0x100052A2 that checks some values in the registry entry (<em>HKLM/SOFTWARE/Microsoft/Windows/CurrentVersion/WorkTime</em> and <em>WorkTimes</em>)</p><p><strong>11. What does the export <code>PSLIST</code> do?</strong></p><p>It returns a list of the processes that have been created after calling <em>CreateToolhelp32Snapshot</em>.</p><p><strong>12. Use the graph mode to graph the cross-references from sub_10004E79. Which API functions could be called by entering this function? Based on the API functions alone, what could you rename this function?</strong></p><p>The function calls <a href=https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winnls/nf-winnls-getsystemdefaultlangid><em>GetSystemDefaultLangID</em></a> that returns the language identifier for the system locale. This is the language used when displaying text in programs that do not support Unicode.
After that, it calls subroutine 0x100038EE that sends the information through the socket.
We could rename the function to <em>GetSystemLanguage</em>.<figure><img src=../5-8.PNG></figure></p><p><strong>13. How many Windows API functions does DllMain call directly? How many at a depth of 2?</strong></p><p>DllMain (function 0x1000D02E) calls directly <em>CreateThread</em>, <em>strncpy</em>, <em>function 0x10001074</em> and strlen.
At depth 2 we observe the API functions called by <em>function 0x10001074</em>.<figure><img src=../5-9.PNG></figure></p><p><strong>14. At 0x10001358, there is a call to Sleep (an API function that takes one parameter containing the number of milliseconds to sleep). Looking backward through the code, how long will the program sleep if this code executes?</strong></p><p>Sleep takes as a parameter the value in <em>iVar1</em>. As we can see, <em>atoi</em> function is called and converts the value given from a string to an integer. We also have to take into account that there is an offset (0xD = 13 in decimal) that removes the first part of the buffer <em>[This_is_CTI]</em>. This way, we only keep 30 seconds as a parameter.</p><figure><img src=../5-10.PNG></figure><p><strong>15. At 0x10001701 is a call to socket. What are the three parameters?</strong>
<strong>16. Using the MSDN page for socket and the named symbolic constants functionality in IDA Pro, can you make the parameters more meaningful? What are the parameters after you apply changes?</strong></p><p>The three parameters are AF (2 = AF_INET aka IPv4), type (1 = SOCK_STREAM aka TCP) and protocol (6 = IPPROTO_TCP).<figure><img src=../5-11.PNG></figure></p><p><strong>17. Search for usage of the <code>in</code> instruction (opcode 0xED). This instruction is used with a magic string VMXh to perform VMware detection. Is that in use in this malware? Using the cross-references to the function that executes the in instruction, is there further evidence of VMware detection?</strong></p><p>In Ghidra we click <code>Search</code> → <code>InstructionPattern</code> and <code>Enter Bytes Manually</code> where we insert ED (input mode HEX).<figure><img src=../5-12.PNG></figure></p><p>Once we have found the function that uses this instruction we search for cross-references of this function.<figure><img src=../5-12-1.PNG></figure></p><p>As we can observe in the decompile window, there are signs of anti-virtualization techniques.<figure><img src=../5-12-2.PNG></figure></p><p><strong>18. Jump your cursor to 0x1001D988. What do you find?</strong></p><p>There are a bunch of characters that do not seem to express anything coherent.<figure><img src=../5-13.PNG></figure></p><p><strong>19. If you have the IDA Python plug-in installed (included with the commercial version of IDA Pro), run Lab05-01.py, an IDA Pro Python script provided with the malware for this book. (Make sure the cursor is at 0x1001D988.) What happens after you run the script?</strong>
<strong>20. With the cursor in the same location, how do you turn this data into a single ASCII string?</strong></p><p>As I am not working with IDA Pro I am not able to answer these questions.</p><p><strong>21. Open the script with a text editor. How does it work?</strong></p><p>It seems to XOR a range of bytes in order to decode some part of the code.</p></section><div class=post-tags><nav class="nav tags"><h2 class=title>Tags</h2><ul class=tags><li><a href=/tags/practical-malware-analysis>practical malware analysis</a></li><li><a href=/tags/malware>malware</a></li><li><a href=/tags/reversing>reversing</a></li><li><a href=/tags/advanced>advanced</a></li><li><a href=/tags/static>static</a></li><li><a href=/tags/analysis>analysis</a></li><li><a href=/tags/x86>x86</a></li><li><a href=/tags/x64>x64</a></li><li><a href=/tags/assembly>assembly</a></li><li><a href=/tags/registers>registers</a></li><li><a href=/tags/ida>ida</a></li><li><a href=/tags/ghidra>ghidra</a></li></ul></nav></div></article></main><footer><div style=display:flex><a class=soc href=https://github.com/pabdj title=GitHub><i data-feather=github></i></a>
