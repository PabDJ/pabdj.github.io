To convert the DLL file into an executable, modify the PE header wiping the IMAGE_FILE_DLL (0x2000) flag from the Characteristics field in the IMAGE_FILE_HEADER. DLL malware may also need to be installed as a service, sometimes with a convenient export such as InstallService, as listed in ipr32x.</description></item><item><title>Basic Static Techniques - Notes &amp; Labs</title><link>https://pabdj.github.io/posts/basicstatictechniques_notesandlabs/basicstatictechniques_notesandlabs/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Dec 2022 12:50:58 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://pabdj.github.io/posts/basicstatictechniques_notesandlabs/basicstatictechniques_notesandlabs/</guid><description>Notes Hashing: A Fingerprint for Malware We will use HashCalc tool.
Finding Strings For this task we will use FLOSS (FLARE Obfuscated String Solver) tool
Packed and Obfuscated Malware Packed and obfuscated code will often include at least the functions LoadLibrary and GetProcAddress, which are used to load and gain access to additional functions. UPX: the Ultimate Packer for eXecutables Several Microsoft Windows functions allow programmers to import linked functions not listed in a program&amp;rsquo;s file header.</description></item><item><title>Create your own malware analysis lab</title><link>https://pabdj.github.io/posts/create-your-own-malware-analysis-lab/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Dec 2022 12:50:58 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://pabdj.github.io/posts/create-your-own-malware-analysis-lab/</guid><description>The first thing in order to analyse malware is setting up a safe environment with a large set of tools that help you in this task.
As we do not want to infect our host system, we are going to use virtual machines without Internet connection. First of all, we are going to deploy an analysis machine which will have Windows as Operative System and a REMnux machine which will act as a DHCP server.</description></item><item><title>My Awesome List</title><link>https://pabdj.github.io/posts/my-awesome-list/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Nov 2022 20:50:58 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://pabdj.github.io/posts/my-awesome-list/</guid><description>As a person who is always willing to learn new stuff, one thing that characterizes me is the obsession to save content for the future. The problem of saving content in different social networks is that you end up forgetting about it, and you do not put it in practice. The goal of this post, that will be continuing evolving, is to organise those resources in a useful list.
If you have something cool, and you do not find it here, do not hesitate to contact me via Twitter @pabdjf and I will include it.</description></item><item><title>The purpose of starting a blog</title><link>https://pabdj.github.io/posts/the-purpose-of-starting-a-blog/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Nov 2022 20:50:58 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://pabdj.github.io/posts/the-purpose-of-starting-a-blog/</guid><description>When it comes to content on the Internet, the vast majority of people stick to a passive role, that is, only consuming content. In the case of educational content it can be explained with a very logical reason: there are more things to learn than to teach. Although this is true, I also think that most of the people, including me, prefer to keep a low profile and don&amp;rsquo;t expose to the outer side.</description></item></channel></rss>
