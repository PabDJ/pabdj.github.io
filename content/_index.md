## Who am I?
I am Pablo de Juan and I consider myself a passionate person who likes being involved in bleeding-edge technology.

I am currently working at [Eviden](https://eviden.com/) (former [Atos](https://atos.net/en/)) as a Cybersecurity R&D Engineer.
I have previously worked as a Cryptography Engineer at [Decentralized Security](https://decentralizedsecurity.es/).

I have a keen interest in malware analysis, advanced persistent threats (APTs), threat intelligence and reverse engineering.
