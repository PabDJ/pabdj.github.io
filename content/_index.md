## Who am I?
I am Pablo de Juan and I consider myself a passionate person who likes being involved in bleeding-edge technology.

I am currently working at [Atos](https://atos.net/en/) as a Cybersecurity R&D Engineer.
I have previously worked as an Embedded System Engineer at [Decentralized Security](https://decentralizedsecurity.es/) in which I was involved in cryptography projects.

I have a keen interest in malware analysis, advanced persistent threats (APTs), threat intelligence and reverse engineering.

## [Blog](https://pabdj.github.io/posts/)
With these posts I want to share the journey of a malware researcher noob. It will be a space to keep the notes I take as I learn and thus keep track of progress as in a journal.
